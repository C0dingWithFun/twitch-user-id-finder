# Twitch User ID Finder

This website is created to help me with makine one of my tutorial video on my YouTube channel: <a href="https://youtube.codingwith.fun">Coding With Fun</a>. To stay focused on particular topic and avoid explaining unrelated code (how to fetch userId), I created this simple open source website to keep it simple! If you find any bug on this site or if you want to redesign it, feel free to create issue or PR on the GitHub repo <a href="https://github.com/C0dingWithFun/twitch-user-id-finder">here</a>.
